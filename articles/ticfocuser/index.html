    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Initial note: I'm currently using the INDI platform on Linux. Without developing a driver, this project won't work on ASCOM.</p>

<p>This is a project I actually finished many months ago. I wanted to extend my astrophoto setup with motor focuser and I haven't found any DIY focuser project which fullfils my requirements. So for these reasons I decided to create something from scratch:</p>

<ul>
<li>DIY focuser is much cheaper than a manufactured one,</li>
<li>DIY is more fun,</li>
<li>I wanted something small and simple for astrophotography, without an external controller,</li>
<li>I wanted a focuser which can be connected directly to a computer (PC, Laptop or RaspberryPi), so USB seemed to be the best choice,</li>
<li>As always I wanted something aesthetic.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was considering couple options, like Arduino+DRV or RaspberryPi+DRV. RPi is basically too big (and dosn't work on 12V out of the box). Arduino is a nice option (still no 12V), however more heavy in work as software needs to be written for both Arduino and PC. Then I found <a href="https://www.pololu.com/category/212/tic-stepper-motor-controllers">Pololu Tic</a> controller.</p>

<p><figure><img src="pololu_tic.png" alt="Pololu Tic controler"></figure></p>

<p>It is relatively cheap, small and among others, it supports USB (no need for GPIOs or extra Arduino). Also what's important PC part of the software is <a href="https://github.com/pololu/pololu-tic-software">open-source</a> and well <a href="https://pololu.com/docs/0J71">documented</a>.</p>

<p>BOM:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pololu Tic T500 (source: official website): $19.95</li>
<li>NEMA-17 step motor (source: aliexpress): $7.11</li>
<li>DC barrel socket, wires, screws, mounting bracket, etc (guesstimate): $13.00</li>
<li>3D printed case (estimate): $10</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: $50</p>

<p>I have created an INDI driver for this focuser and <a href="https://github.com/sebo-b/TicFocuser-ng">published and described the project on github</a>. So I'm not going to repeat it here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 120%"><a href="https://github.com/sebo-b/TicFocuser-ng">For more details please follow this link</a>.</span></p>

<p>How it looks like? Here is a 3D project and final product mounted on my tube with Baader Diamond Steeltrack focuser.</p>

<p><figure><img src="ticfocuser_final.png" alt="TicFocuser"></figure></p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What's next</h2>

<p>I've already started working on the next version of this focuser. What I'm planning to acheive is:</p>

<ul>
<li>add Bluetooth, and then also Bluetooth LE,</li>
<li>add temperature sensor to automatically compensate in the driver,</li>
<li>use smaller stepper motor - still NEMA-17 but more pancake (this one: 17Hs08-1004S),</li>
<li>to additionally reduce the size: replace back case of stepper motor with the 3d printed case.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to finish this project in a month or two - so stay tuned!</p>
