      <description>For the last few years, my hobby is astronomy. During that time I had to figure out many details in the area of optics, photography, equipment and to some degree physics. What is a difference between MAK and SCT, what kind of eyepiece should I buy, what camera is the best for me and still in the budget and how to connect all these pieces, etc.
So far I haven&#39;t found a place where all this information is together in the form and detail I expect.</description>
